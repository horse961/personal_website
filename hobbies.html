                    <p>Videogames are the thing that led me to approach technology in a very regular way, starting from
                        the most
                        common consoles when i was not even a teenager (Nintendo DS, WII, PS3, ..)
                        to videogames you can download on any medium-end machine. At that age i was a huge fan of the
                        Super Mario games and the
                        Pok√®mon ones too (let's be honest, who didn't love them?)<br><br>
                        In the last years i mainly played games on my Desktop PC, i totally left consoles apart, i
                        personally find them too limited and not performant<br>
                        The games i played the most in the last years on my PC are Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,
                        Warframe,
                        World of Tanks, Apex Legends, Forza Horizon 3/4, although there are many more.<br>
                        I do not really have a favourite videogame genre, i kinda like anything (driving, FPS games,
                        tactic
                        games, MMORPGs, battle royales, horror games, etc.)

                        I had my first programming approach at the age of 12 with Java. I actually used to play
                        Minecraft with mods and plugins and it led my curiosity about the topic to
                        grow even furtherly, so i did my first attempts and actually managed to create simple working
                        plugins and mods and also understand important concepts (e.g. OOP)<br>
                        Later at high school, i had the opportunity to learn Python as programming language, but also
                        web-oriented languages<br>
                        in my maturity project, like JavaScript (with frameworks like NodeJS or Express).<br><br>
                        As of now i'm attending the informatics faculty at USI, and for now as a new programming
                        language i learned Racket.
                        I"m excited about learning more to be able to make more complex and good projects
