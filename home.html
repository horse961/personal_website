                        I started attending an elementary school in Pregassona, a fraction of Lugano.
                        My first interaction with videogames (initially with consoles) was in these years. I actually
                        still rarely play some games on the Nintendo DS
                        I always had an interested into understanding how these consoles (computers, theoretically) and
                        always was attracted to anything related to technology.<br>
                        I grew when technology definitely had started to impressively impact people's daily life and
                        this also led me to grow an interest in it, and in informatics especially,
                        although my parents aren't really into technology.

                        I attended at Pregassona the medium schools, and at that point i could definetely confirm that i
                        had a passion
                        and a interest into technology, informatics and programming. At the times i had my first
                        programming approaches with Java.<br><br>
                        Later on, i attended the Liceo Lugano 1 high school and managed to obtain 6/6 grades both in
                        informatics and in the LAM (maturity project) in informatics.
                        I was definetely sure on which study path chose.
